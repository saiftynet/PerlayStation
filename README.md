# PerlayStation Games Console

A  collection of console based based games for the terminally minded people.  These are a set of Perl applications that offer that work on a ASNI capable terminal. I will place open source offerings by other people in one folder, mainly for reference and inspiration.  but the main area of my interest is to delvelop an reasonably comprehensive SDK for Perl terminal games using Term::Graille and other Pure Perl libraries , which forms the basis of the project. The terminal is a limited capability platform, so we are not expecting Hi-Res, high speed, graphics Intensive pwoer house gaming, but the games should be playable, interesting, diverse, but most significantly all have very litlle in the way of dependency, and most critically as close to Pure Perl as possible.

## Motivation

The objectives are multiple, but primarily game development allows one to explore many aspects of programming in any language, and acquiring a tool or toolkit that eases  features such as 

* User Interactivity, from key preses, dialog boxes and menus
* Graphical operations, the drawing of lines, shapes and animations
* Sound manipulation, audio ncapture and speech synthesis
* Object such as sprites, transformations, collisons, mathematics and physics

Being able to access all of these in a console application is one goal.  But an equally important goal is achieve this without any external libraries as far as possible.
